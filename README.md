# WFH (We have Food at Home!)

*Reduce food waste and do more home cooking by finding recipes based on ingredients you have!*

### Features
**An anonymous user can:**
- Search for recipes of a food/drink (for example, pasta)
- Do an *Advanced Search* to filter recipes based on what ingredients they have and other choices, such as number of results to return, dietary restrictions, and any ingredients to exclude

**A logged in user can:**
- Do everything an anonymous user can
- Signup with their dietary restrictions and allergies, which will automatically be applied when they do an Advanced Search
- Save recipes for future reference
- Update/delete their own profile
